\title{Filter the DAG}
\usage{
dag_filter(dag, terms = NULL, relations = NULL, root = NULL, leaves = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{dag}{A \code{ontology_DAG} object.}

\item{terms}{A vectof of term names. The sub DAG will only contain these terms.}

\item{relations}{A vector of relations. The sub DAG will only contain these relations.}

\item{root}{A vector of root terms. Only they with their offspring terms will be kept.}

\item{leaves}{A vector of leaf terms. Only they with their ancestor terms will are kept.}
}
\value{
An \code{ontology_DAG} object.
}
\description{
Filter the DAG
}
\details{
If the DAG is reduced into several disconnected parts after the term filtering, a
super root is automatically added.
}
\examples{
parents  = c("a", "a", "b", "b", "c", "d")

dag_filter(dag, terms = c("b", "d", "f"))
dag_filter(dag, root = "b")
dag_filter(dag, leaves = c("c", "b"))
